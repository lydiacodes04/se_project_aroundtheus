# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Project features
- Plans for improvement

**Intro**
This project was my first attempt to create a responsive website. As a Triple Ten Bootcamp student, I was charged with replicating the following Figma design: [Figma project design](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

The instructors provided us with videos assisting us in the basic structure of the project, but they provided us with no written code. We had to write all the HTML and CSS ourselves. In addition, the details of the responsive design were also up to us to construct.

**Project features**
Here are a few screenshots of the project:

I created a video describing the project's features. You can view it here:

**Plans for improvement**
My plans for improving the project include making it more interactive. Our instructors have informed us that we will continue to build upon this project in future learning modules. I would like for users to be able to create their own profiles and customize them, replacing this sample user's name with their own, and uploading their own pictures. I would also like for other users to be able to "heart" and comment on the user's pictures. In addition, I mentioned a few minor adjustments I would like to make in order for the responsiveness of the sight to be enhanced.
