**Intro**
This project was my first attempt to create a responsive website. As a Triple Ten Bootcamp student, I was charged with replicating the following Figma design: [Figma project design](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

The instructors provided us with videos assisting us in the basic structure of the project, but they provided us with no written code. We had to write all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ourselves. In addition, the details of the responsive design were also up to us to construct.

**Project**

I created an initial video describing the project's features. You can view it here:

**Plans for improvement**
My plans for improving the project include making it increasingly more interactive. I would like for users to be able to see other users' profiles and for users to be able to comment on each others' pictures.
